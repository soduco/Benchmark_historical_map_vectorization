# Contribution information

Yizi proposed the pipeline of this work, annotating Atlas Municipal and Verniquet dataset, re-implement missing deep learning models, running and export full benchmark tables and writing the first draft of the full paper.
Baptiste implements the hierarchy watershed, vectorization algorithm and some bindings to accelerate which greatly accelerate the benchmark processes.
Edwin provide in-depth supervision for Meyer and Hierarchy watershed algorithm on both code and context of the paper.
Minh provides fast version of BALoss and other topology losses and test it first with historical maps.
Joseph provide large amount of supervision in the whole process of this work, correcting and rephasing of the whole paper.
Bertrand add more perfessional information in the introduction session to explain the background of the historical maps (TODO).
Cl√©ment provide in-depth supervision on how to design the structure of whole paper.
Julien fixes the detail of vectorization algorithm, provide in-depth supervision for making the whole paper better.

Acknowledgemenet:
We also thank Xiaoling Hu for providing code and details on how to train topoloss in different datasets.
